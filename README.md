Book List using React and Next.js  
boostrapped with create-next-app  

My first foray into the world of Next.js, with many thanks to Shaun at (Net Ninja)[https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja/playlists]  

Thoughts:
1. I appreciate the way links are baked in.
2. The on-screen error messages aren't quite as terrifying. 
3. Deploying on vercel was a piece of cake!  

Find the site deployed here => [https://book-list-nine.vercel.app/]

At this point, it is pretty much a copy of the site built in the tutorial, however I have grand plans for it!
Future additions: connection to a book-centered api (Google Books?)  
                  GraphQL to make data calls and post inputs to database
                  Authorization with admin and visitor designations
                  Better themed styling
